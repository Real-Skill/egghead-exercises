#Exercise 25 : $routeProvider

##Summary
You are provided with templates and controllers. Use your knowledge of services such as `$routeProvider`, `$routeParams` to configure routing.

##Goals

* set `home.html` as a default page with appropriate controller (that initialize car brand and capacity) 
* brand and engine capacity from inputs should be used as route params (**hint:**  look at `home.html` "Next" button)
* **Next** button should redirect to details.html page if both parameters were entered (path should start with `details/`)
* there is the secret page - your job is to get us there 
* having entered the word `spy` in any of the fields, you should be directed to `secret.html` page  (**hint:** check if the path contains the word `spy`)
