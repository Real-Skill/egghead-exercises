## Exercise 52: transformResponse

## Summary
You start with broken application that should displayed list of GitHub users (with avatar, login, url repository and GitHub user type). All you need to do is
 transform response data from `https://api.github.com/users` to reach specific data

## Goals
* `apiResponse` factory should transform response data to form only with avatar, login, url repository and GitHub user type
* `api` factory should use transformed data
* take a look at ready view to get names of `user` properties

## Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-transformresponse](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-transformresponse)

## Setup
 You should have installed `yarn`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. To resolve dependencies run:

```
yarn install
```

```
bower install
```

To run the application:

```
grunt serve
```

To run unit tests:

```
grunt karma
```

Good luck!
