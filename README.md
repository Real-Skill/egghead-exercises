# Exercise 2 : Controller

## Summary
Applications often need to display values that a user has entered. You are provided with a simple view containing title, three inputs and display board. Your task is to
implement functionality that will allow inputs to be displayed along with the information on the title and board.

## Goals

* add three properties in controller, namely: `seller, name, count` with default values set to : **'Mr. John'**, **'apple'** and **3**.
* replace comments in `index.html` with appropriate values from the inputs
