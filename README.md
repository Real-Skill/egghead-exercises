## Exercise 41 : Introduction to ui-router

## Summary
Create navigation to the application displaying the most popular paintings. Use an alternative to AngularJS's default  routing module `ui-router`. The 
application consists of three main parts : **Start** - the welcome page, **Vertical Paintings** - displays the known vertical paintings, **Horizontal 
Paintings** - displays the known horizontal paintings. Each paining has some details that should be displayed after clicking on chosen painting.


Controllers and `welcome.html`, `paintingDetails.html` pages are ready.

## Goals 
* you should implement three main states: `start`, `vPaintings`, `hPaintings`
* connect navigation button with states 
* configure routing knowing that the state name is associated with url path
* add `detail` state for `vPaintings` and `hPaintings` states
* add `ng-href` with appropriate path to each paining list

## Setup
 You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. To resolve dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To run the application:

```
grunt serve
```

To run cucumber tests:

```
grunt test
```

To run unit tests:

```

Good luck!
