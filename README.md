## Exercise 30 : Providers

## Summary
Application displays sentence with `color` and `number` set by the factory. Your job is refactor the `Home` factory to provider. This will give you the same result but it is a different method to achieve it.

## Goals
* `number` should be equal to 100 when set number is even or 99 when set number is odd
* `number` and `color` should be easily set using provider in application configuration 
* create `setColor` and `setNumber` functions inside provider

## Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-providers](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-providers)

## Setup
 You should have installed `yarn`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. To resolve dependencies run:
 
 ```
 yarn install
 ```
 
 ```
 bower install
 ```
 
 To run the application:
 
 ```
 grunt serve
 ```
 
To run unit tests:

 ```
 grunt karma
 ```
 
Good luck!
