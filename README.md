# Exercise 3 : Sharing data between controllers

## Summary
Controllers often need to communicate and share data with each other. You are given a task to create a functionality to share data between two controllers.
Modify `index.html` file to share data between `LeftCtrl` and `RightCtrl`.

## Goal
Use **ng-model** in appropriate places to ensure that after typing something in left or right input, both message holders are updated. Remember that all inputs 
should be bound to the same property. Don't change the `controllers.js` file.

**Hint**
Take a look at `ng-init` directive in `index.html` file
