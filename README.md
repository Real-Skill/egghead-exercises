#Exercise 20 : angular.element

##Summary
You start with a basic application that displays one input field.
The application should display a circle or square based on the input values.

##Goals
Complete the `findElement` directive:

 * it should be restricted as an element.
 * create new **h4** DOM element 
 * the new element should be appended and compiled as the directive template
 * the directive should react to any changes to the **input**.
    * when the **input** value is set to: *circle* or *square*, element class should be changed respectively to a `circle` or `square`.
    * in other cases, it should display a red message *`You did not enter *circle* or *square*`* (using **text-danger** class).
 
To add class to the element use **addClass('className')** function, to remove it use **removeClass('className')** and to add the text use **text(''someText')**.
