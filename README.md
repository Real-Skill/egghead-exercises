## Exercise 48: Testing a Service

## Summary

You are provided with the `User` service uses five functions `save`,`get`,`remove`, `getAll` and `count`. Test this service as best you can.

## Goals

Your task is to write unit tests to `User` service. It is composed of five functions:

 * `save(user)` - add new user to `users` object or edit existing user  
 * `get(id)` - return specified user
 * `remove(id)` - delete specific user
 * `getAll()`- return users list
 * `count()` - return the number of users 

To tests your unit tests use `grunt mutationTest`
