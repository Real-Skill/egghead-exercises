## Exercise 31 : Injectors

## Summary
Application should display song details and two buttons `Sing` and `Fake`. The application at this moment is not working correctly, the song is not displayed and the buttons are not working. Your job is to bind values from the `Song` factory to the proper models in the view using the `$injector`.

## Goals
* use $injector to get the data from `Song` factory.
* bind `author`, `title`, `sing` and `fake` factory properties to the relevant controller fields.

## Before you start, please refer to:
* [angularjs-injectors](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-injectors)

## Setup
 You should have installed `yarn`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. To resolve dependencies run:

```
yarn install
```

```
bower install
```

To run the application:

```
grunt serve
```

To run cucumber tests:

```
grunt test
```

To run unit tests:

```
grunt karma
```

Good luck!
