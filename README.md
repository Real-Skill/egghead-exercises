# Exercise 33b: ng-repeat and $index, $event, $log

## Summary
This exercise is about **ng-repeat** directive with `$index`, `$event` and `$log`. Application should display a numbered list of buttons. Third and 
seventh button should be highlighted and after pressing redirect

## Goals
* display all elements from the `list` as  numbered from 1 buttons list
* set `id` button attribute to appropriate `$index` value
* add appropriate class to buttons 1
* after pressing the `Do nothing` button, you should see the message with coordinates
* after pressing the `Show log` button, you should be redirected to `checkLog.html` page
* on `checkLog.html` page you should see `log` in console (don't use **console.log**. use `debug` mode)

`addClass()` returns the class based on the parameters we send it. You can use it with ng-class directive based on example:

`< div ng-class="getClass(key)" >`
